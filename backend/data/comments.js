		text: "Why couldn't they just employ 2 crossing guards, one on each carriage way to stop the traffic? It would be cheaper than building any infrastructure and the crossing guards will be cheap to employ by the school or council and will give an older person a job. Pearson St in Woodlands has this type of school crossing set up and it doesn't hold up the traffic very much and it is cheap as consists of painted lines on the road and a few crossing signs installed .",
