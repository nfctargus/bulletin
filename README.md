# Bulletin News

Welcome to my project for the open-source news website I am building in React. The backend is a very simple NodeJS server with Express.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Project Set Up

To run this project yourself please follow the below instructions:

1. Clone this repository and install all dependencies with `npm install` for both the frontend and backend folders
2. Run the server with `node server.js` from the backend folder
3. Run the frontend with `npx next dev` from the frontend folder
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
